# Project Communication Plan and comunication

## Platform Selection

To ensure effective communication and collaboration, we have chosen GitHub as our primary platform, building upon the successful approach used in our previous project "Battle Royale with Dynamic Environments." GitHub provides a centralized repository for our project files, facilitating seamless collaboration among team members. It allows us to share updates, track changes, and manage issues efficiently. Additionally, GitHub provides version control, ensuring that the team works with the latest and most accurate project data.

## Communication Goal

The primary goal of our communication plan is to keep all stakeholders well-informed about the project's progress, milestones, and challenges, as demonstrated in our previous project. By establishing clear communication channels, we aim to foster collaboration, maintain transparency, and enable stakeholders to advocate effectively for the project.

## Stakeholder Identification

Identifying key stakeholders is crucial for targeted communication, as outlined in our previous project. Our stakeholder list includes team members, project managers, marketing specialists, QA testers, and external contributors. Prioritization is based on their level of influence and interest in the project, determining the frequency and depth of communication required.

## Methods of Communication

Understanding diverse communication preferences, we have established various methods to reach stakeholders effectively, drawing from our experience:

- **Bi-weekly Team Meetings (Friday Updates):** Internal team meetings for project updates, idea sharing, and issue resolution, following the successful model of our previous project.
- **GitHub Repository:** Centralized platform for file sharing, version control, and collaborative coding, replicating the efficient approach used in the Battle Royale project.
- **Email Communication:** For sharing critical updates, bug reports, and sensitive information, consistent with the communication practices implemented previously.
- **Ad-hoc Meetings:** Scheduled as needed for urgent matters or milestone celebrations, maintaining flexibility as demonstrated in our past project.

## Frequency of Communication

To maintain a well-informed team and stakeholders, we have defined the frequency of communication, aligning with the successful practices of our previous project:

- **Bi-weekly Team Meetings:** Every Friday for internal updates, issue discussion, and idea sharing.
- **GitHub Updates:** Continuous updates as team members contribute to the repository.
- **Email Updates:** As needed for critical information, bug reports, and security-related matters.

## Communication Updates Provider

While the project manager (Yaser Omar) plays a central role, communication updates are a collaborative effort, following the successful team collaboration model in the Battle Royale project:

- **Project Manager:** Overseeing the overall communication strategy and ensuring information flow.
- **Team Leads:** Providing specific team updates to the project manager.
- **Team Members:** Actively contributing to GitHub, sharing progress, and reporting issues.

## Handling Sensitive Information

For scenarios involving sensitive information, especially security-related matters, we continue to follow secure communication protocols:

- **Email Communication:** Use encrypted channels for confidential data transmission.
- **Clear Protocols:** Established protocols for sharing sensitive information, ensuring secure and controlled communication.

## Adapting to Changes

Recognizing that projects may evolve, the communication plan remains adaptable, learning from the iterative approach applied in our previous project:

- **Regular Review:** Periodic reviews of the communication plan to align with project changes.
- **Flexibility:** Willingness to modify communication methods based on project dynamics and stakeholder needs.

## Implementation and Standardization

To ensure a smooth adoption of the communication plan:

- **Training:** Team members briefed on the communication plan during onboarding.
- **Feedback Loop:** Encouraging feedback to identify areas of improvement.
- **Documentation:** A concise reference document summarizing the communication plan for quick accessibility.
